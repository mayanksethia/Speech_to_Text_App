# Speech_to_Text_App
You can give your speech input by holding the recording button in the app. On releasing the button you will see your output on the screen. On saving it , it gets stored on google firebase database. I made this app for a competition, where we pulled the output from firebase database using python and sent the output to arduino which controlled the motors, fans leds etc. We were attempting a home automation system and an enhanced lifestyle system. I made this app using android studio. I have also uploaded the apk file so that you can directly run in on your phone. You can directly change the firebase link in this app and add your firebase link , and have it running!
